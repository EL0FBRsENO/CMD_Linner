# CMD_Linner
# Description
 A terminal like app that you (will) can do cool things :)

# What I want to do with this project:
 - Make the terminal work
 - Make you use functions (that's the part were's the terminal work, you know)
 - Let you create custom functions
 - Save, Open, Export and Import the functions
 - ETC (Pls send me ideas to do before I make the rest)

 # Why I want to do this?
 This terminal came from a idea to make a language and I wanted this terminal have a source code

 # Where I'm making this terminal
 I'm making this terminal in the better engine on the EARTH, GameMaker Studio 2. Yes, I know, it's to good to make just a little terminal

 Yes, I know, I have to put more things in this README
